# kanban-board
framework agnostic kanban-board

This started as a just for fun project, but it is actually quite time consuming searching for what I need on the Mdn docs. But at least it did give me quite an insight into DOM building from scratch, and the inner-workings.

Tbh, it is better to just use native React library with no framework as compared to just vanilla javascript. Will still continue to add random stuff whenever I feel like it.
